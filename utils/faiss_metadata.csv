These changes differ from the scope of the prior text revision, DSM-IV-TR, in which the updates were confined almost exclusively to the text, leaving the diagnostic criteria virtually unchanged.

The clinical and research understanding of mental disorders continues to advance. As a result, most of the DSM-5-TR disorder texts have had at least some revision since the 9 years from original publication in DSM-5, with the overwhelming majority having had significant revisions.

"xxiii Mental Disorders (DSM) is a classification of mental disorders with associated criteria designed to facilitate more reliable diagnoses of these disorders. With successive editions over the past 60 years, it has become a standard reference for clinical practice in the mental health field. Since a complete description of the underlying pathological processes is not possible for most mental disorders, it is important to emphasize that the current diagnostic criteria are the best available description of how mental disorders are expressed and can be recognized by trained clinicians. DSM is intended to serve as a practical, functional, and flexible guide for organizing information that can aid in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. It is a tool for clinicians, an essential educational resource for students and practitioners, and a reference for researchers in the field.

"Although this edition of DSM was designed first and foremost to be a useful guide to clinical practice, as an official nomenclature it must be applicable in a wide diversity of contexts. DSM has been used by clinicians and researchers from different orientations (biological, psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, family/systems), all of whom strive for a common language to communicate the essential characteristics of mental disorders presented by their patients. The information is of value to all professionals associated with various aspects of mental health care, including psychiatrists, other physicians, psychologists, social workers, nurses, counselors, forensic and legal specialists, occupational and rehabilitation therapists, and other health professionals. The criteria are concise and explicit and intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settings—inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison,",DSM-book_54,The American Psychiatric  Association’S  Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,37

Finally, the criteria and corresponding text serve as a textbook for students early in their profession who need a structured way to understand and diagnose mental disorders as well as for seasoned professionals encountering rare disorders for the first time. Fortunately, all of these uses are mutually compatible. These diverse needs and interests were taken into consideration in planning DSM-5. The classification of disorders is harmonized with the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the official coding system used in the United States, so that the DSM criteria define disorders identified by ICD",DSM-book_55,The American Psychiatric  Association’S  Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,37

Other enhancements have been introduced to promote ease of use across all settings: xxiv Representation of developmental issues related to diagnosis. The change in chapter organization better reflects a lifespan approach, with disorders more frequently diagnosed in childhood (e.g., neurodevelopmental disorders) at the beginning of the manual and disorders more applicable to older adulthood (e.g., neurocognitive disorders) at the end of the manual.

Age-related factors specific to diagnosis (e.g., symptom presentation and prevalence differences in certain age groups) are also included in the text. For added emphasis, these age-related factors have been added to the criteria themselves where applicable (e.g., in the criteria sets for insomnia disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, specific criteria describe how symptoms might be expressed in children). Likewise, gender and cultural issues have been integrated into the disorders where applicable. Integration of scientific findings from the latest research in genetics and neuroimaging.

Genetic and physiological risk factors, prognostic indicators, and some putative diagnostic markers are highlighted in the text.

Rather than separating the definition of manic, hypomanic, and major depressive episodes from the definition of bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and major depressive disorder as in the previous edition, we included all of the component criteria within the respective criteria for each disorder. This approach will facilitate bedside diagnosis and treatment of these important disorders. Likewise, the explanatory notes for differentiating bereavement and major depressive disorder will provide far greater clinical guidance than was previously provided in the simple bereavement exclusion criterion.

The categories of substance abuse and substance dependence have been eliminated and replaced with an overarching new category of substance use disorders—with the specific substance used defining the specific disorders. “Dependence” has been easily confused with the term “addiction” when, in fact, the tolerance and withdrawal that previously defined dependence are actually very normal responses to prescribed medications that affect the central nervous system and do not necessarily indicate the presence of an addiction. By revising and clarifying these criteria in DSM-5, we hope to alleviate some of the widespread misunderstanding about these issues.",DSM-book_61,The American Psychiatric  Association’S  Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,38
"Enhanced specificity for major and mild neurocognitive disorders. Given the explosion in neuroscience, neuropsychology, and brain imaging over the past 20 years, it was critical to convey the current state-of-the-art in the diagnosis of specific types of disorders that were previously referred to as the “dementias” or organic brain diseases. Biological markers identified by imaging for vascular and traumatic brain disorders and xxv specific molecular genetic findings for rare variants of Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease have greatly advanced clinical diagnoses, and these disorders and others have now been separated into specific subtypes.

"disorders to one based on the relative distribution of personality traits has not been widely accepted. In DSM-5, the categorical personality disorders are virtually unchanged from the previous edition. However, an alternative “hybrid” model has been proposed in Section III to guide future research that separates interpersonal functioning assessments and the expression of pathological personality traits for six specific disorders. A more dimensional profile of personality trait expression is also proposed for a trait-specified approach. Section III: new disorders and features. A new section (Section III) has been added to highlight disorders that require further study but are not sufficiently well established to be a part of the official classification of mental disorders for routine clinical use. Dimensional measures of symptom severity in 13 symptom domains have also been incorporated to allow for the measurement of symptom levels of varying severity across all diagnostic groups.",DSM-book_63,The American Psychiatric  Association’S  Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,39

The Introduction begins with a description of the DSM-5 and DSM-5-TR revision processes, followed by an overview of the DSM-5 organizational structure (e.g., regrouping of disorders, harmonization with ICD-11) and key conceptual issues, such as the definition of a mental disorder, categorical and dimensional approaches to diagnosis, cultural and social structural issues, and sex and gender differences. Use of the Manual features information to facilitate the use of DSM-5, such as a brief overview of the diagnostic process, use of subtypes and specifiers, other specified and unspecified mental disorder categories, use of clinical judgment, coding and recording procedures, notes about terminology, descriptions of the types of information in the DSM-5-TR text, and online enhancements.

"5 (DSM-5) was a massive undertaking that involved hundreds of people working toward a common goal over a 12-year period. Much thought and deliberation were involved in evaluating the diagnostic criteria, considering the organization of every aspect of the manual, and creating new features believed to be most useful to clinicians, such as dimensional measures that can help to identify emerging symptoms or determine and monitor changes in severity. All of these efforts have been directed toward the goal of enhancing the usefulness of DSM-5 as a clinical guide in the diagnosis of mental disorders, as well as its value for research. DSM-5 strives to fulfill the need of clinicians, patients, families, and researchers for a clear and concise description of each mental disorder, which has been operationalized using diagnostic criteria that are supplemented by dimensional measures of severity and is accompanied by a digest of information about the diagnosis, including risk factors and culture-",DSM-book_190,The Creation  Of The Fifth Edition Of  Diagnostic And Statistical Manual Of Mental Disorders,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,94

Clinical training and experience are needed to use DSM for determining a clinical diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria identify symptoms and signs comprising affects, behaviors, cognitive functions, and personality traits along with physical signs, symptom combinations (syndromes), and durations that require clinical expertise to differentiate from normal variation and transient responses to stress. The diagnostic process can be facilitated by a thorough examination of the range of symptoms that might be present, such as by conducting a review of mental systems using the DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure as recommended by The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice Guidelines for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults (see “Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures”).

The use of the term “reaction” throughout the classification reflected the influence of Adolf Meyer’s psychobiological view that mental disorders represented reactions of the personality to psychological, social, and biological factors. In the development of the second edition (DSM-II), a decision was made to base the classification on the mental disorders section of 6 the eighth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-8), for which representatives of the APA had provided consultation. Both DSM-II and ICD-8 went into effect in 1968. As had been the case for DSM-I and DSM-II, the development of DSM-III was coordinated with the development of the International Classification of Diseases , specifically ICD-9, which was published in 1975 and implemented in 1978.

Spitzer, M.D., introduced a number of important methodological innovations, including explicit diagnostic criteria and a descriptive approach that attempted to be neutral with respect to theories of etiology of mental disorders. Experience with DSM-III revealed a number of inconsistencies in the system. Therefore, the APA appointed a Workgroup to Revise DSM-III, which developed the revisions and corrections that led to DSM-III-R in 1987. DSM-IV was published in 1994. It was the culmination of a 6-year effort that involved more than 1,000 individuals and numerous professional organizations. Much of the effort involved conducting a comprehensive review of the literature to establish a firm empirical basis for making modifications. Developers of DSM-IV and the tenth revision of the ICD worked closely to coordinate their efforts, resulting in increased congruence between the two systems. ICD-10 was published in 1992.

"In 1999, the APA launched an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of DSM. This effort was coordinated with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Division of Mental Health, the World Psychiatric Association, and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in the form of several conferences, the proceedings of which were published in the 2002 monograph A Research Agenda for DSM-V . Thereafter, from 2003 to 2008, a cooperative agreement between the APA and WHO, supported by the NIMH, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), led to the convening of 13 international DSM-5 research planning conferences, involving 400 participants from 39 countries, to review the world literature in specific diagnostic areas to prepare for revisions in developing both DSM-5 and the International Classification of Diseases , 11th Revision (ICD- 11).

More than 400 additional work group advisors with no voting authority were also approved to participate in the process. A clear concept of the next evolutionary stage for the classification of mental disorders was central to the efforts of the task force and the work groups. This vision emerged as the task force and work groups recounted the history of DSM-IV’s classification, its current strengths and limitations, and strategic directions for its revision. 7 An intensive 6-year process involved conducting literature reviews and secondary analyses, publishing research reports in scientific journals, developing draft diagnostic criteria, posting preliminary drafts on the DSM-5 website for public comment, presenting preliminary findings at professional meetings, performing field trials, and",DSM-book_200,"3 Years, The Imposition Of An Income Cap From All Commercial Sources, And The Publication Of",Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,96

"Proposals for the revision of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were developed by members of the work groups on the basis of rationale, scope of change, expected impact on clinical management and public health, strength of the supporting research evidence, overall clarity, and clinical utility. Proposals encompassed changes to diagnostic criteria; the addition of new disorders, subtypes, and specifiers; and the deletion of existing disorders. In the proposals for revisions, strengths and weaknesses in the current criteria and nosology were first identified. Novel scientific findings over the previous two decades were considered, leading to the creation of a research plan to assess potential changes through literature reviews and secondary data analyses. Four principles guided the draft revisions: 1) DSM-5 is primarily intended to be a manual to be used by clinicians, and revisions must be feasible for routine clinical practice; 2) recommendations for revisions should be guided by research",DSM-book_202,Proposals For Revisions,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,96

Inclusion of a proposal for revision in Section II was informed by consideration of its advantages and disadvantages for public health and clinical utility, the strength of the evidence, and the magnitude of the change. New diagnoses and disorder subtypes and specifiers were subject to additional stipulations, such as demonstration of reliability (i.e., the degree to which two clinicians could independently arrive at the same diagnosis for a given patient). Disorders with low clinical utility and weak validity were considered for deletion. Placement of proposed conditions in “Conditions for Further Study” in Section III was contingent on the amount of empirical evidence generated on the proposed diagnosis, diagnostic reliability or validity, presence of clear clinical need, and potential benefit in advancing research.",DSM-book_204,Proposals For Revisions,Depression,DSM-book,reference,97
"The use of field trials to empirically demonstrate reliability was a noteworthy improvement introduced in DSM-III. The design and implementation strategy of the DSM-5 Field Trials represented several changes from approaches used for DSM-III and DSM-IV, particularly in obtaining data on the precision of kappa reliability estimates (a statistical measure that assesses level of agreement between raters that corrects for chance agreement due to prevalence rates) in the context of real-world clinical settings with high levels of diagnostic comorbidity. For DSM- 5, field trials were extended by using two distinctive designs: one in large, diverse medical- academic settings and the other in routine clinical practices. The former capitalized on the need for large sample sizes to test hypotheses on 8 reliability and clinical utility of a range of diagnoses in a variety of patient populations; the latter supplied valuable information about how proposed revisions performed in everyday clinical",DSM-book_205,Dsm-5 Field Trials,General,DSM-book,reference,97

It is anticipated that future clinical and basic research studies will focus on the validity of the revised categorical diagnostic criteria and the underlying dimensional features of these disorders (including those now being explored by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria initiative). The medical-academic field trials were conducted at 11 North American medical-academic sites from December 2010 to October 2011 and assessed the reliability, feasibility, and clinical utility of select revisions, with priority given to those that represented the greatest degree of change from DSM-IV or those potentially having the greatest public health impact.

Each proposal for diagnostic revision required a memorandum of evidence for change prepared by the work group and accompanied by a summary of supportive data organized around validators for the proposed diagnostic criteria (i.e., antecedent validators such as familial aggregation, concurrent validators such as biological markers, and prospective validators such as response to treatment or course of illness).

"The groups tasked with revising the DSM and ICD systems shared the overarching goal of harmonizing the two classifications as much as possible, for the following reasons: The existence of two major classifications of mental disorders hinders the collection and use of national health statistics, the design of clinical trials aimed at developing new treatments, and the consideration of global applicability of the results by international regulatory agencies. More broadly, the existence of two classifications complicates attempts to replicate scientific results across national boundaries. Even when the intention was to identify identical patient populations, DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnoses did not always agree.

Some improvement in harmonization at the disorder level was still achieved; many ICD-11 working group members had participated in the development of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, and the ICD-11 working groups were instructed to review the DSM-5 criteria sets and to strive to make ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines as similar to DSM-5 as possible unless there was a considered reason for them to differ.

Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities.

The diagnosis of a mental disorder should have clinical utility: it should help clinicians to determine prognosis, treatment plans, and potential treatment outcomes for their patients. However, the diagnosis of a mental disorder is not equivalent to a need for treatment. Need for treatment is a complex clinical decision that takes into consideration symptom severity, symptom salience (e.g., the presence of suicidal thoughts), the individual’s distress (mental pain) associated with the symptom(s), disability related to the individual’s symptoms, risks and benefits of available treatments, and other factors (e.g., psychiatric symptoms complicating other illness).

The fact that some individuals do not show all symptoms indicative of a diagnosis should not be used to justify limiting their access to appropriate care. It should be noted that the definition of mental disorder was developed for clinical, public health, and research purposes.

Relevant evidence of such problems includes high rates of comorbidity among disorders, symptom heterogeneity within disorders, and the substantial need for other specified and unspecified diagnoses to classify the substantial number of clinical presentations that do not meet criteria for any of the specific DSM disorders. Studies of both genetic and environmental risk factors, whether based on twin designs, familial transmission, or molecular analyses, have also raised questions about whether a categorical approach is the optimal way to structure of the DSM system. There is broad recognition that a too-rigid categorical system does not capture clinical experience or important scientific observations.

A dimensional approach classifies clinical presentations on the basis of quantification of attributes rather than the assignment to categories and works best in describing phenomena that are distributed continuously and that do not have clear boundaries. Although dimensional systems increase reliability and communicate more clinical information 15 (because they report clinical attributes that might be subthreshold in a categorical system), they also have serious limitations, and thus far, they have been less useful than categorical systems in clinical practice.

Moreover, as yet there is no agreement on the choice of the optimal dimensions to be used for classification purposes. Nonetheless, with the increasing research on, and familiarity with, dimensional systems and the establishment of clinically meaningful cut points to guide treatment decisions, greater acceptance of dimensional approaches both as a method of conveying clinical information and as a research tool is eventually likely. For reasons of both clinical utility and compatibility with the categorical ICD classification required for coding, DSM-5 continues to be a primarily categorical classification with dimensional elements that divides mental disorders into types based on criteria sets with defining features.

There is also no assumption that all individuals described as having the same mental disorder are alike in all important ways. The clinician using DSM-5 should therefore consider that individuals sharing a diagnosis are likely to be heterogeneous even in regard to the defining features of the diagnosis and that boundary cases will be difficult to diagnose in any but a probabilistic fashion.

"Historically, the construct of the culture-bound syndrome was a focus of work on descriptive phenomenology in cultural psychiatry and psychology. Since DSM-5, this construct has been replaced by three concepts that offer greater clinical utility: 17 1. Cultural idiom of distress refers to a behavior or linguistic term, phrase, or way of talking about symptoms, problems, or suffering among individuals with similar cultural backgrounds to express or communicate essential features of distress (e.g., stating, “I feel so depressed” to express low mood or discouragement that does not meet the threshold for major depressive",DSM-book_252,Cultural Concepts Of Distress,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,107
"disorder). An idiom of distress need not be associated with specific symptoms, syndromes, or perceived causes. It may be used to convey a wide range of discomfort, including everyday concerns, subclinical conditions, or suffering due to social circumstances rather than mental disorders. For example, most cultural groups have common bodily idioms of distress used to express a wide range of suffering and concerns. 2. Cultural explanation or perceived cause refers to a label, attribution, or feature of an explanatory model that provides a culturally coherent concept of etiology or cause for symptoms, illness, or distress (e.g., the attribution of psychopathology to “stress,” spirits, or failure to follow culturally prescribed practices). Causal explanations may be salient features of local classifications of disease used by laypersons or healers. 3. Cultural syndrome refers to a cluster or group of co-occurring, distinctive symptoms found in specific cultural groups, communities, or",DSM-book_253,Cultural Concepts Of Distress,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,108

Second, sex or gender may moderate the overall risk for development of a disorder as shown by marked differences in the prevalence and incidence rates for selected mental disorders in men and women. Third, sex or gender may influence the likelihood that particular symptoms of a disorder are experienced by an individual. For example, ADHD may manifest differently in boys and girls. Sex or gender may also have other effects on the experience of a disorder that are indirectly relevant to psychiatric diagnosis.

As a result, it is important to note that the definition of mental disorder included in DSM-5 was developed to meet the needs of clinicians, public health professionals, and research investigators rather than the technical needs of the courts and legal professionals. It is also important to note that DSM-5 does not provide treatment guidelines for any given disorder.

Once thought to be categorically defined, more recent dimensional approaches to measurement of the symptoms demonstrate a range of severity, often without a very clear boundary with typical development.

Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, including deficits in social reciprocity, nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and skills in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships. In addition to the social communication deficits, the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder requires the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Because symptoms change with development and may be masked by compensatory mechanisms, the diagnostic criteria may be met based on historical information, although the current presentation must cause significant impairment. Within the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, individual clinical characteristics are noted through the use of specifiers (with or without accompanying intellectual impairment; with or without accompanying structural language impairment;",DSM-book_327,The Neurodevelopmental Disorders  Are A Group Of Conditions With Onset In The,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,132

These specifiers provide clinicians with an opportunity to individualize the diagnosis and communicate a richer clinical description of the affected individuals. For example, many individuals previously diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder would now receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder without language or intellectual impairment. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by impairing levels of inattention, disorganization, and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity.

In childhood, ADHD frequently overlaps with disorders that are often considered to be “externalizing disorders,” such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder. ADHD often persists into adulthood, with resultant impairments of social, academic, and occupational functioning.

The onset can be insidious or more sudden. Typically, dysfluencies start gradually, with repetition of initial consonants, first words of a phrase, or long words. The child may not be aware of dysfluencies. As the disorder progresses, the dysfluencies become more frequent and interfering, occurring on the most meaningful words or phrases in the utterance. As the child becomes aware of the speech difficulty, he or she may develop mechanisms for avoiding the 53 dysfluencies and emotional responses, including avoidance of public speaking and use of short and simple utterances.

A substantial proportion of children with ADHD remain relatively impaired into adulthood. In preschool, the main manifestation is hyperactivity.

One essential feature of specific learning disorder is persistent difficulties learning keystone academic skills (Criterion A), with onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e., the developmental period). Key academic skills include reading of single words accurately and fluently, reading comprehension, written expression and spelling, arithmetic calculation, and mathematical reasoning (solving mathematical problems).

"milestones that emerge with brain maturation, academic skills (e.g., reading, spelling, writing, mathematics) have to be taught and learned explicitly. Specific learning disorder disrupts the normal pattern of learning academic skills; it is not simply a consequence of lack of opportunity of learning or inadequate instruction. Difficulties mastering these key academic skills may also impede learning in other academic subjects (e.g., history, science, social studies), but those problems are attributable to difficulties learning the underlying academic skills. 79 Difficulties learning to map letters with the sounds of one’s language—to read printed words (often called dyslexia [specific learning disorder with impairment in reading])—is one of the most common manifestations of specific learning disorder. The learning difficulties manifest as a range of observable, descriptive behaviors or symptoms (as listed in Criteria A1–A6). These clinical symptoms may be observed, probed by means of",DSM-book_546,Diagnostic Features,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,181
"symptoms (as listed in Criteria A1–A6). These clinical symptoms may be observed, probed by means of the clinical interview, or ascertained from school reports, rating scales, or descriptions in previous educational or psychological assessments.

In children and adolescents, persistence is defined as restricted progress in learning (i.e., no evidence that the individual is catching up with classmates) for at least 6 months despite the provision of extra help at home or school. For example, difficulties learning to read single words that do not fully or rapidly remit with the provision of instruction in phonological skills or word identification strategies may indicate a specific learning disorder.

"measures, or clinical interview.

A second key feature is that the individual’s performance of the affected academic skills is well below expected for age (Criterion B). One robust clinical indicator of difficulties learning academic skills is low academic achievement for age or average achievement that is sustainable only by extraordinarily high levels of effort or support. In children, the low academic skills cause significant interference in school performance (as indicated by school reports and teacher’s grades or ratings).

Low achievement scores on one or more standardized tests or subtests within an academic domain (i.e., at least 1.5 standard deviations [SD] below the population mean for age, which translates to a standard score of 78 or less, which is below the 7th percentile) are needed for the greatest diagnostic certainty.

"On the basis of clinical judgment, a more lenient threshold may be used (e.g., 1.0 SD below the population mean for age), when learning difficulties are supported by converging evidence from clinical assessment, academic history, school reports, or test scores. Moreover, since standardized tests are not available in all languages, the diagnosis may then be based in part on clinical judgment of scores on available test measures. A third core feature is that the learning difficulties are readily apparent in the early school years in most individuals (Criterion C). However, in others, the learning difficulties may not manifest fully until later school years, by which time learning demands have increased and exceed the individual’s limited capacities. Another key diagnostic feature is that the learning difficulties are considered “specific” for four reasons. First, they are not better explained by intellectual developmental disorders (intellectual developmental disorder [intellectual",DSM-book_551,Diagnostic Features,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,182

The phrase “unexpected academic 80 underachievement” is often cited as the defining characteristic of specific learning disorder in that the specific learning disabilities are not part of a more general learning difficulty as manifested in intellectual developmental disorder or global developmental delay.

Specific learning disorder may also occur in individuals identified as intellectually “gifted.” These individuals may be able to sustain apparently adequate academic functioning by using compensatory strategies, extraordinarily high effort, or support, until the learning demands or assessment procedures (e.g., timed tests) pose barriers to their demonstrating their learning or accomplishing required tasks.

If the substance-induced psychotic disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.959 phencyclidine- induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication).

"Bipolar I disorder is characterized by a clinical course of recurring mood episodes (manic, depressive, and hypomanic), but the occurrence of at least one manic episode is necessary for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. The essential feature of a manic episode is a distinct period during which there is an abnormally, persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently increased activity or energy that is present for most of the day, nearly every day, for a period of at least 1 week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary), accompanied by at least three additional symptoms from Criterion B. If the mood is irritable rather than elevated or expansive, at least four Criterion B symptoms must be present. Mood in a manic episode is often described as euphoric, excessively cheerful, high, or “feeling on top of the world.” In some cases, the mood is of such a highly infectious quality that it is easily recognized as excessive and may be characterized by unlimited",DSM-book_883,Diagnostic Features,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,260

Rapid shifts in mood over brief periods of time may occur and are referred to as lability (i.e., the alternation among euphoria, dysphoria, and irritability). In children, happiness, silliness, and “goofiness” are normal in many social contexts; however, if these symptoms are recurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the developmental level of the child, they may meet the Criterion A mood requirement of abnormally elevated mood.

The projects are often initiated with little knowledge of the topic, and nothing seems out of the individual’s reach. The increased activity or energy levels may manifest at unusual hours of the day, such as during the individual’s normal sleep phase. Inflated self-esteem is typically present, ranging from uncritical self-confidence to marked grandiosity, and may reach delusional proportions (Criterion B1). Despite lack of any particular experience or talent, the individual may embark on complex tasks such as writing a novel or seeking publicity for some impractical invention. Grandiose delusions (e.g., of having a special relationship to a famous person) are common.

One of the most common features is a decreased need for sleep (Criterion B2), which is distinct from insomnia (during which the individual wants to sleep or feels the need to sleep but is unable to). The individual may sleep little, if at all, or may awaken several hours earlier than usual, feeling rested and full of energy. When the sleep disturbance is severe, the individual may go for days without sleep, yet not feel tired. Often decreased need for sleep heralds the onset of a manic episode. Speech can be rapid, pressured, loud, and difficult to interrupt (Criterion B3). Individuals may talk continuously and without regard",DSM-book_887,Diagnostic Features,General,DSM-book,reference,261

When flight of ideas is severe, speech may become disorganized, incoherent, and particularly distressing to the individual. Sometimes thoughts are experienced as so crowded that it is very difficult to speak. Distractibility (Criterion B5) is evidenced by an inability to censor immaterial external stimuli (e.g., the interviewer’s attire, background noises or conversations, furnishings in the room) and often prevents individuals experiencing mania from holding a rational conversation or attending to instructions. 145 The increase in goal-directed activity (Criterion B6) often consists of excessive planning and participation in multiple activities, including sexual, occupational, political, or religious",DSM-book_889,Diagnostic Features,General,DSM-book,reference,261

Some individuals write excessive letters, e-mails, text messages, and so forth, on many different topics to friends, public figures, or the media.

For example, individuals from different cultural backgrounds with bipolar I disorder, with psychotic features, may vary in the prevalence of flight of ideas or types of delusions (e.g., grandiose, persecutory, sexual, religious, or somatic). Cultural factors may affect disorder prevalence. For example, countries with reward-oriented cultural values that place significance on individual pursuit of reward have a relatively higher prevalence of bipolar disorder.

When the individual presents in an episode of major depression, it is therefore important to actively probe for a history of mania or hypomania.

In contrast, the symptoms of mania in bipolar I disorder occur in distinct episodes and typically begin in late adolescence or early adulthood. In individuals with severe irritability, particularly children and adolescents, care must be taken to apply the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder only to those who have had a clear episode of mania or hypomania—that is, a distinct time period, of the required duration, during which the irritability was clearly different from the individual’s baseline and was accompanied by the onset of the other characteristic symptoms of mania (e.g., grandiosity,",DSM-book_916,Differential Diagnosis,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,267

Indeed, when any child is being assessed for mania, it is essential that the symptoms represent a clear change from the child’s typical behavior. 150 Personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder may have substantial symptomatic overlap with bipolar I disorder, since mood lability and impulsivity are common in both conditions.

About 5%–15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder will ultimately develop a manic episode, which changes the diagnosis to bipolar I disorder, regardless of subsequent course. Making the diagnosis in children is often a challenge, especially in those with irritability and hyperarousal that is nonepisodic (i.e., lacks the well-demarcated periods of altered mood). Nonepisodic irritability in youth is associated with an elevated risk for anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, but not bipolar disorder, in adulthood. Persistently irritable youth have lower familial rates of bipolar disorder than do youth who have bipolar disorder.

Despite the need to consider many other syndromes, differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder and oppositional defiant disorder requires particularly careful assessment. The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and bipolar disorders in children involves the longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In children, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness with discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child’s typical presentation.

Thus, in the case of a manic episode, parents (and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a distinct time period during which the child’s mood and behavior were markedly different from usual. In contrast, the irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent and is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irritability is characteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

Another central differentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common features of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

For this reason, while most children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria for oppositional defiant disorder, the reverse is not the case.

Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall severity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt. The mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the individual as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or “down in the dumps” (Criterion A1).

In some individuals who complain of feeling “blah,” having no feelings, or feeling anxious, the presence of a depressed mood can be inferred from the individual’s facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals emphasize somatic complaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of sadness. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters).

In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire. 186 Appetite change may involve either a reduction or an increase. Some depressed individuals report that they have to force themselves to eat. Others may eat more and may crave specific foods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates).

Initial insomnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with oversleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep. Sometimes the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the disturbed sleep. Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand-wringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased in",DSM-book_1092,Diagnostic Features,Therapy Process,DSM-book,reference,312

Decreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion A6). An individual may report sustained fatigue without physical exertion. Even the smallest tasks seem to require substantial effort. The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced. For example, an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are exhausting and take twice as long as usual.

The sense of worthlessness or guilt may be of delusional proportions (e.g., an individual who is convinced that he or she is personally responsible for world poverty). Blaming oneself for being sick and for failing to meet occupational or interpersonal responsibilities as a result of the depression is very common and, unless delusional, is not considered sufficient to meet this criterion.

When the major depressive episode is successfully treated, the memory problems often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particularly elderly persons, a major depressive episode may sometimes be the initial presentation of an irreversible dementia. Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9) are common. They may range from a passive wish not to awaken in the morning or a belief that others would be better off if the individual were dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of dying by suicide, to a specific suicide plan.

Motivations for suicide may include a desire to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles, 187 an intense wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful emotional state, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the wish to not be a burden to others. The resolution of such thinking may be a more meaningful measure of diminished suicide risk than denial of further plans for suicide.

Information from additional informants can be especially helpful in clarifying the course of current or prior major depressive episodes and in assessing whether there have been any manic or hypomanic episodes. Because major depressive episodes can begin gradually, a review of clinical information that focuses on the worst part of the current episode may be most likely to detect the presence of symptoms.

Nonvegetative symptoms of dysphoria, anhedonia, guilt or worthlessness, impaired concentration or indecision, and suicidal thoughts should be assessed with particular care in such cases.

The course of major depressive disorder is quite variable, such that some individuals rarely, if ever, experience remission (a period of 2 or more months with no symptoms, or only one or two symptoms to no more than a mild degree), while others experience many years with few or no symptoms between discrete episodes. The course of depression may reflect social-structural adversity associated with poverty, racism, and marginalization. It is important to distinguish individuals who present for treatment during an exacerbation of a chronic depressive illness from those whose symptoms developed recently.

Recovery from a major depressive episode begins within 3 months of onset for 40% of individuals with major depression and within 1 year for 80% of individuals.

Features that help differentiate a bereavement-related grief response from a major depressive episode include the following: the predominant affects in grief are feelings of emptiness and loss, whereas in a major depressive episode they are persistent depressed mood and a diminished ability to experience pleasure.

As children age, worries emerge; these are often worries about specific dangers (e.g., accidents, kidnapping, mugging, death) or vague concerns about not being reunited with attachment figures. In adults, separation anxiety disorder may limit their ability to cope with changes in circumstances (e.g., moving, getting married).

"Separation anxiety disorder often develops after life stress, especially a loss (e.g., the death of a relative or pet; an illness of the individual or a relative; a change of schools; parental divorce; a move to a new neighborhood; immigration; a disaster that involved periods of separation from attachment figures). Being bullied during childhood has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of separation anxiety disorder. In young adults, other examples of life stress include leaving the parental home, entering into a romantic relationship, and becoming a parent. A history of parental overprotection and intrusiveness may be associated with separation anxiety disorder in both childhood and adulthood.

Symptoms in adults are often debilitating and affect multiple areas of their lives. For example, adults with separation anxiety disorder may deliberately reorganize their work schedules and other activities because of their anxieties about possible separations from close attachment figures; they may often express frustration with the limitations on their lives because of their need to maintain proximity to, or at least virtual contact with, their key attachment figures (e.g., by texting or phoning them repeatedly throughout the day).

"Situational specific phobia may resemble agoraphobia in its clinical presentation, given the overlap in feared situations (e.g., flying, enclosed places, elevators). If an individual fears only one of the agoraphobic situations, then specific phobia, situational, may be diagnosed. If two or more agoraphobic situations are feared, a diagnosis of agoraphobia is likely warranted. For example, an individual who fears airplanes and elevators (which overlap with the “public transportation” agoraphobic situation) but does not fear other agoraphobic situations would be diagnosed with specific phobia, situational, whereas an individual who fears airplanes, elevators, and crowds (which overlap with two agoraphobic situations, “using public transportation” and “standing in line or being in a crowd”) would be diagnosed with agoraphobia.

If the situations are feared for reasons other than not being able to escape or get help, such as fear of being harmed directly by the object or situation (e.g., fear of the plane crashing, fear of the animal biting), a specific phobia diagnosis may be more appropriate. If the situations are feared because of negative evaluation, social anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia.

For example, individuals with panic disorder often anticipate a catastrophic outcome from a mild physical symptom or medication side effect (e.g., thinking that they may have heart disease or that a headache means presence of a brain tumor). Such individuals often are relatively intolerant of medication side effects. In addition, there may be pervasive concerns about abilities to complete daily tasks or withstand daily stressors, excessive use of drugs (e.g., alcohol, prescribed medications or illicit drugs) to control panic attacks, or extreme behaviors aimed at controlling panic attacks (e.g., severe restrictions on food intake or avoidance of specific foods or medications because of concerns about physical symptoms that provoke panic attacks).",DSM-book_1377,Associated Features,Anxiety,DSM-book,reference,377

"The rate of fears about mental and somatic symptoms of anxiety appears to vary across cultural contexts and may influence the rate of panic attacks and panic disorder. Also, cultural expectations may influence the classification of panic attacks as expected or unexpected. For example, a Vietnamese individual who has a panic attack after walking out into a windy environment ( trúng gió; “hit by the wind”) may attribute the panic attack to exposure to wind as a result of the cultural syndrome that links these two experiences, resulting in classification of the panic attack as expected. Various other cultural concepts of distress are associated with panic disorder, including ataque de nervios (“attack of nerves”) among Latin Americans and khyâl attacks and “soul loss” among Cambodians. Ataque de nervios may involve trembling, uncontrollable screaming or crying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and depersonalization or derealization, which may be experienced longer than the few minutes",DSM-book_1387,Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues,Anxiety,DSM-book,reference,379

Gender differences in clinical course are also found among adolescents. Panic disorder has a larger impact on health-related quality of life in women than in men, which may be attributable to greater anxiety sensitivity among some women or greater comorbidity with agoraphobia and depression.

Several features distinguish the excessive worry of generalized anxiety disorder from the obsessional thoughts of obsessive-compulsive disorder. In generalized anxiety disorder the focus of the worry is about forthcoming problems, and it is the excessiveness of the worry about future events that is abnormal. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, the obsessions are inappropriate ideas that take the form of intrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images. Anxiety is invariably present in posttraumatic stress disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is not diagnosed if the anxiety and worry are better explained by symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.

The difficulty in discarding possessions noted in Criterion A refers to any form of discarding, including throwing away, selling, giving away, or recycling. The main reasons given for this difficulty are the perceived utility or aesthetic value of the items or strong sentimental attachment to the possessions. Some individuals feel responsible for the fate of their possessions and often go to great lengths to avoid being wasteful. Fears of losing important information are also common. The most commonly saved items are newspapers, magazines, clothing, bags, books, mail, and papers, but virtually any item can be saved.

The clinical presentation of PTSD varies. In some individuals, fear-based reexperiencing, emotional, and behavioral symptoms may predominate. In others, anhedonic or dysphoric mood states and negative cognitions may be most prominent. In some other individuals, arousal and reactive-externalizing symptoms are prominent, while in yet others, dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally, some individuals exhibit combinations of these symptom patterns. The following discussion of specific criteria for PTSD refers to specific criteria for adults; criteria for children 6 years or younger may differ in criterion numbering given differences in applicable criteria for this age group. The traumatic events in Criterion A all involve actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in some way but differ",DSM-book_1740,Diagnostic Features,PTSD,DSM-book,reference,460

The disorder may be especially severe or long-lasting when the stressor is interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, sexual violence). The directly experienced traumatic events in Criterion A include, but are not limited to, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, actual or threatened physical assault in which the threat is perceived as imminent and realistic (e.g., physical attack, robbery, mugging, childhood physical abuse), being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist",DSM-book_1741,Diagnostic Features,PTSD,DSM-book,reference,460
"robbery, mugging, childhood physical abuse), being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war, natural or human-made disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents. Sexual trauma includes, but is not limited to, actual or threatened sexual violence or coercion",DSM-book_1742,Diagnostic Features,PTSD,DSM-book,reference,460
"(e.g., forced sexual penetration; alcohol/drug-facilitated nonconsensual sexual penetration; other unwanted sexual contact; and other unwanted sexual experiences not involving contact, such as being forced to watch pornography, exposure to the display of genitals by an exhibitionist, or being the victim of unwanted photography or videotaping of a sexual nature or the unwanted dissemination of these photographs or videos). Being bullied may qualify as a Criterion A1 experience when there is a credible threat of serious harm or sexual violence. For children, sexually violent events may include developmentally inappropriate sexual experiences without physical violence or injury. A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered a traumatic event. Qualifying events of this type include life-threatening medical emergencies (e.g., an acute myocardial infarction, anaphylactic shock) or a particular event in treatment that evokes catastrophic feelings",DSM-book_1743,Diagnostic Features,PTSD,DSM-book,reference,461
"anaphylactic shock) or a particular event in treatment that evokes catastrophic feelings of terror, pain, helplessness, or imminent death (e.g., waking during surgery, debridement of severe burn wounds, emergency cardioversion). Witnessed events (Criterion A2) include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious injury, unnatural death, physical or sexual abuse of another person due to violent assault, domestic violence, accident, war, or disaster. For example, this would include parents witnessing their child in an acute life-endangering incident (e.g., a diving accident) or a medical catastrophe during the course of their child’s illness or ongoing treatment (e.g., a life-threatening hemorrhage). Indirect exposure through learning about an event (Criterion A3) is limited to events affecting close relatives or friends that were violent or accidental (i.e., death from natural causes does not qualify). Such events include murder, violent personal assault, combat, terrorist",DSM-book_1744,Diagnostic Features,Therapy Process,DSM-book,reference,461

The indirect exposure of professionals to the grotesque effects of war, rape, genocide, or abusive violence inflicted on others occurring in the context of their work duties can also result in PTSD and thus is considered to be a qualifying trauma (Criterion A4). Examples 306 include first responders exposed to serious injury or death and military personnel collecting human remains. Indirect exposure can also occur through photos, videos, verbal accounts, or written accounts (e.g., police officers reviewing crime reports or conducting interviews with crime victims, drone operators, members of the news media covering traumatic events, and psychotherapists exposed to details of their patients’ traumatic experiences). Exposure to multiple traumatic events is common and can take many forms. Some individuals experience different",DSM-book_1745,Diagnostic Features,PTSD,DSM-book,reference,461
"multiple traumatic events is common and can take many forms. Some individuals experience different types of traumatic events at different times (e.g., sexual violence during childhood and natural disaster as adults). Others experience the same type of traumatic event at different times or in a series committed by the same person/people over an extended period (e.g., child sexual or physical assault; physical or sexual assault by an intimate partner). Others may experience numerous traumatic events that are the same or different during an extended hazardous period such as deployment or living in a conflict zone. When one is assessing the PTSD criteria in individuals who have experienced multiple traumatic events across their lives, it may be useful to determine if there is a specific, discrete example that the individual considers to be the worst given that the symptomatic expressions of PTSD Criterion B and Criterion C specifically refer to the traumatic event (e.g., recurrent,",DSM-book_1746,Diagnostic Features,PTSD,DSM-book,reference,461

"intrusive distressing recollections of the traumatic event). However, if it is difficult for the individual to identify a worst example, it is appropriate to consider the entire exposure as meeting Criterion A. In addition, some discrete events may incorporate several traumatic event types (e.g., an individual involved in a mass casualty incident sustains a major injury, witnesses someone else being injured, and then learns that a family member was killed in the incident). The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual has recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion B1). Intrusive recollections in PTSD are distinguished from depressive rumination in that they apply only to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories. The emphasis is on recurrent memories of the event that usually include intrusive, vivid, sensory, and emotional components that are distressing and not merely ruminative.

"and emotional components that are distressing and not merely ruminative. A common reexperiencing symptom is distressing dreams that replay the event itself or that are representative or thematically related to the major threats involved in the traumatic event (Criterion B2). The individual may experience dissociative states that typically last a few seconds and rarely are of a longer duration, during which components of the event are relived and the individual behaves as if the event were occurring at that moment (Criterion B3). Such events occur on a continuum, ranging from brief visual or other sensory intrusions about part of the traumatic event without loss of reality orientation to a partial loss of awareness of present surroundings to a complete loss of awareness. These episodes, often referred to as “flashbacks,” are typically brief but can be associated with prolonged distress and heightened arousal. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may be expressed",DSM-book_1749,Diagnostic Features,PTSD,DSM-book,reference,462
"heightened arousal. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may be expressed behaviorally in play or in dissociative states. Intense psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological reactivity (Criterion B5) often occurs when the individual is exposed to triggering events or somatic reactions that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., windy days after a hurricane, seeing someone who resembles one’s perpetrator). The triggering cue could also be a physical sensation (e.g., dizziness for survivors of head trauma, rapid heartbeat for a previously traumatized child), particularly for individuals with highly somatic presentations. Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently avoided. The individual commonly makes deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts, memories, or feelings (e.g., by utilizing distraction or suppression techniques, including substance use, to avoid internal reminders) (Criterion C1), and to avoid activities,",DSM-book_1750,Diagnostic Features,PTSD,DSM-book,reference,462

Negative alterations in cognitions or mood associated with the traumatic event begin or worsen after exposure to the event. These negative alterations can take various forms, including an inability to remember key and emotionally painful aspects of the traumatic 307 event. Such memory loss is typically attributable to dissociative amnesia and is not attributable to head injury or impaired encoding of the memory due to drug or alcohol use (Criterion D1). Individuals with PTSD often report that the traumatic event has irrevocably altered their lives and their view of the world. This is characterized by persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs and expectations regarding important aspects of life applied to themselves, others, the world, or the future (Criterion D2) (e.g., “Bad things will always",DSM-book_1751,Diagnostic Features,PTSD,DSM-book,reference,462

"“My life is permanently ruined”; “I have lost any chance for future happiness”; “My life will be cut short”). Individuals with PTSD may have persistent erroneous cognitions about the causes of the traumatic event that lead them to blame themselves or others (e.g., “It’s all my fault that my uncle abused me”) (Criterion D3). A persistent negative mood state (e.g., fear, dysphoria, horror, anger, guilt, shame) either began or worsened after exposure to the event (Criterion D4). The individual may experience markedly diminished interest or participation in previously enjoyed activities (Criterion D5), may feel detached or estranged from other people (Criterion D6), or may experience a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (especially happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, and sexuality) (Criterion D7).

"reactivity also begin or get worse after exposure to the event. Individuals with PTSD may exhibit irritable or angry behavior and may engage in aggressive verbal or physical behavior with little or no provocation (e.g., yelling at people, getting into fights, destroying objects) (Criterion E1). They may also engage voluntarily in reckless or self-destructive behavior that is dangerous, that shows a disregard for the physical safety of themselves or others, and that could directly result in serious physical harm or death (Criterion E2). Examples include, but are not limited to, dangerous driving (e.g., drunk driving, driving at dangerously high speeds), excessive alcohol or drug use, having risky sex (e.g., unprotected sex with a partner whose HIV status is unknown, high number of sexual partners), or self-directed violence including suicidal behaviors. Criterion E2 does not include circumstances in which individuals must engage in dangerous situations as a part of their job (e.g.,",DSM-book_1754,Diagnostic Features,PTSD,DSM-book,reference,463

PTSD is often characterized by a heightened vigilance for potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic experience (e.g., following a motor vehicle accident, being especially sensitive to the threat potentially caused by cars or trucks) and those not related to the traumatic event (e.g., being fearful of suffering a heart attack) (Criterion E3).

Startle responses are distinguished from the cued physiological arousal responses in Criterion B5, for which there needs to be at least some level of conscious appraisal that the stimulus producing physiological responses is related to the trauma. Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily events (e.g., forgetting one’s telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e.g., following a conversation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported (Criterion E5).

The prevalence of PTSD may vary across development; children and adolescents, including preschool children, generally have displayed lower prevalence following exposure to serious traumatic events; however, this may be because previous criteria were insufficiently developmentally informed. Racial differences, based on DSM-IV data, show higher rates of PTSD among U.S. Latinx, African Americans, and American Indians compared with Whites.

"PTSD can occur at any age, beginning after the first year of life. Symptoms usually begin within the first 3 months after the trauma, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before full criteria for the diagnosis are met. There is abundant evidence for what DSM-IV called “delayed onset” but is now called “delayed expression,” with the recognition that some symptoms typically appear immediately and that the delay is in meeting full criteria. Frequently, an individual’s reaction to a trauma initially meets criteria for acute stress disorder in the immediate aftermath of the trauma. The symptoms of PTSD and the 309 relative predominance of different symptoms may vary over time.

Young children may report new onset of frightening dreams without content specific to the traumatic event. Children age 6 and younger may develop PTSD as a result of severe emotional abuse (e.g., threat of abandonment), which can be perceived as life-threatening.

They may not manifest fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or during reexperiencing. Parents may report a wide range of emotional or behavioral changes in young children. Children may focus on imagined interventions in their play or storytelling. In addition to avoidance, children may become preoccupied with reminders.

"Risk factors for PTSD can operate in many ways, including predisposing individuals to trauma or to extreme emotional responses when exposed to traumatic events. Risk (and protective) factors are generally divided into pretraumatic, peritraumatic, and posttraumatic factors. Pretraumatic Factors High-risk factors include childhood emotional problems by age 6 years (e.g., externalizing or anxiety problems) and prior mental disorders (e.g., panic disorder, depressive disorder, PTSD, or obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]). Individual differences in premorbid personality may influence the trajectory of response to trauma and treatment outcomes.

Individuals who feign the symptoms of dissociative identity disorder usually create limited, stereotyped alternate identities, with feigned amnesia related only to the events for which gain is sought, with apparent switching behaviors and amnesia only displayed while being observed.

The onset of this disorder is often associated with a stressful life event, such as leaving home for college. The course and outcome of anorexia nervosa are highly variable. Younger individuals may manifest atypical features, including denying “fear of fat.” Older individuals more likely have a longer duration of illness, and their clinical presentation may include more signs and symptoms of long-standing disorder. Clinicians should not exclude anorexia nervosa from the differential diagnosis solely on the basis of older age.

For example, an individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and then continue to eat on returning home. Continual snacking on small amounts of food throughout the day would not be considered an eating binge. An occurrence of excessive food consumption must be accompanied by a sense of lack of control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of binge eating. An indicator of loss of control is the inability to refrain from eating or to stop eating once started. Some individuals describe a dissociative quality during, or following, the binge-eating episodes. The impairment in control associated with binge eating may not be absolute; for example, an individual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a roommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room.

Some individuals report that their binge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control but rather by a more generalized pattern of uncontrolled eating. If individuals report that they have abandoned efforts to control their eating, loss of control should be considered as present. Binge eating can also be planned in some instances. The type of food consumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a given individual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the amount of food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient. However, during binges, individuals tend to eat foods they would otherwise avoid. Individuals with bulimia nervosa are typically ashamed of their eating problems and attempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as inconspicuously as possible.

"that precipitated the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation and dysphoria often are the delayed consequences. Another essential feature of bulimia nervosa is the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain (Criterion B). Many individuals with bulimia nervosa employ several methods to compensate for binge eating. Self-induced vomiting, a type of purging behavior, is the most common inappropriate compensatory behavior. The immediate effects of vomiting include relief from physical discomfort and reduction of fear of gaining weight. In some cases, vomiting becomes a goal in itself, and the individual will binge eat in order to vomit or will vomit after eating a small amount of food. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may use a variety of methods to induce vomiting, including the use of fingers or instruments to stimulate the gag reflex.

Other purging behaviors include the misuse of laxatives and diuretics and, in rare cases, the misuse of enemas following episodes of binge eating, although this is seldom the sole compensatory method employed. A number of compensatory methods other than purging may also be used in rare cases. Some individuals may take thyroid hormone in an attempt to avoid weight gain. Individuals with diabetes mellitus and bulimia nervosa may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to reduce the metabolism of food consumed during eating binges.

REM sleep, during which the majority of typical story-like dreams occur, occupies about 20%–25% of total sleep. NREM sleep stage 1 (N1) is a transition from wakefulness to sleep and occupies about 5% of time spent asleep in healthy adults. NREM sleep stage 2 (N2), which is characterized by specific electroencephalographic waveforms (sleep spindles and K complexes), occupies about 50% of time spent asleep. NREM sleep stage 3 (N3) (also known as slow-wave sleep) is the deepest level of sleep and occupies about 20% of sleep time in healthy, younger adults.",DSM-book_2289,Key Concepts And Terms,General,DSM-book,reference,588
"These sleep stages have a characteristic temporal organization across the night. N3 tends to occur in the first one-third to one-half of the night and increases in duration in response to sleep deprivation. REM sleep occurs cyclically throughout the night, alternating with NREM sleep about every 80–100 minutes. REM sleep periods increase in duration toward the morning. Human sleep also varies characteristically across the life span. After relative stability with large amounts of slow-wave sleep in childhood and early adolescence, sleep continuity and depth deteriorate across the adult age range. This deterioration is reflected by increased wakefulness and N1 sleep and decreased N3 sleep. Because of this, age must be considered in the diagnosis of a sleep disorder in any individual.

The amount of time required to fall asleep (sleep latency) is measured on each trial and is used as an index of physiological sleepiness. The following standard terminology for polysomnographic measures is used throughout the text in this chapter, and other terms provide context for the chapter discussion: Sleep continuity refers to the overall balance of sleep and wakefulness during a night of sleep. “Better” sleep continuity indicates consolidated sleep with little wakefulness or fragmentation; “worse” sleep continuity indicates disrupted sleep with more wakefulness and fragmentation.

The reasons for this discrepancy are not well understood, but disturbances in the underlying neurophysiology reflective of hyperarousal or cortical activation are believed to play a role. Nonrestorative sleep, a complaint of poor sleep quality that does not leave the individual rested upon awakening despite adequate duration, is a common sleep complaint usually occurring in association with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or less frequently in isolation.

Impairment in cognitive performance may include difficulties with attention, concentration and memory, and performing complex manual skills. Associated mood disturbances are typically described as irritability or mood lability and less commonly as depressive or anxiety symptoms.

A preoccupation with sleep and distress attributable to the inability to sleep may lead to a vicious cycle: the more the individual strives to sleep, the more frustration builds and further impairs sleep. Thus, excessive attention and efforts to sleep, which override normal sleep-onset mechanisms, may contribute to the development of insomnia. Individuals with persistent insomnia may also acquire maladaptive sleep habits (e.g., spending excessive time in bed; following an erratic sleep schedule; napping) and cognitions (e.g., fear of sleeplessness; apprehensions of daytime impairments; clock monitoring) during the course of the disorder.

In young children, the signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may be more subtle than in adults, making diagnosis more difficult to establish. Polysomnography is useful in confirming diagnosis. Evidence of fragmentation of sleep on the polysomnogram may not be as apparent as in studies of older individuals, possibly because of the high homeostatic drive in young individuals. Symptoms such as snoring are usually parent-reported and thus have reduced sensitivity. Agitated arousals and unusual sleep postures, such as sleeping on the hands and knees, may occur. Nocturnal enuresis also may occur and should raise the suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea if it recurs in a child who was previously dry at night.",DSM-book_2416,Development And Course,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,616

There is also no clear diagnostic delineation between delayed ejaculation as a sexual dysfunction and delay that is a consequence of normal aging. Therefore, the diagnosis of delayed ejaculation is based on clinical judgment, taking into consideration the individual’s psychosexual and medical history, age, relationship context, and sexual stimulation patterns and behaviors.

Delayed ejaculation is associated with highly frequent masturbation, use of masturbation techniques not easily duplicated by a partner, and marked disparities between sexual fantasies during masturbation and the reality of sex with a partner. Males with delayed ejaculation typically report less coital activity, higher levels of relationship distress, sexual dissatisfaction, lower subjective arousal, anxiety about their sexual performance, and general health issues than sexually functional men.

"When an assessment for male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is being made, interpersonal context must be taken into account. A “desire discrepancy,” in which a man has lower desire for sexual activity than his partner, is not sufficient to diagnose male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Both low/absent desire for sex and deficient/absent sexual thoughts or fantasies (Criterion A) are required for a diagnosis of the disorder. There may be variation across men in how sexual desire is expressed. The lack of desire for sex and deficient/absent erotic thoughts or fantasies must be persistent or recurrent and must occur for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months. The inclusion of this duration criterion is meant to safeguard against making a diagnosis in cases in which a man’s low sexual desire may represent a reactive but temporary response to adverse life conditions.

Sexual activities (e.g., masturbation or partnered sexual activity) may sometimes occur even in the presence of low sexual desire. Relationship-specific preferences regarding patterns of sexual initiation must be taken into account when making a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

Individuals assigned male at birth with gender dysphoria without a DSD (in both childhood and adolescence) more commonly have older brothers when compared with cisgender males.

Craving has also been shown to involve classical conditioning and is associated with activation of specific reward structures in the brain. Craving might be queried by asking if there has ever been a time when there were such strong urges to take the drug that the individual could not think of anything else. Current craving is often used as a treatment outcome measure because it may be a signal of impending relapse. Social impairment is the second grouping of criteria (Criteria 5–7).

Tolerance (Criterion 10) is signaled by requiring a markedly increased dose of the substance to achieve the desired effect or a markedly reduced effect when the usual dose is consumed. The degree to which tolerance develops varies greatly across different individuals as well as across substances and may involve a variety of central nervous system effects. For example, tolerance to respiratory depression and tolerance to sedating and motor coordination may develop at different rates, depending on the substance.

Withdrawal (Criterion 11) is a syndrome that occurs when blood or tissue concentrations of a substance decline in an individual who had maintained prolonged, heavy use of the substance.

The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D).

For example, moderate cocaine doses may initially produce gregariousness, but social withdrawal may develop if such doses are frequently repeated over days or weeks. When used in the physiological sense, the term intoxication is broader than the diagnosis of substance intoxication as defined in this manual.

These measures do not establish a diagnosis of an alcohol-related disorder but can be useful in highlighting individuals for 559 whom more information should be gathered. The most direct test available to measure alcohol consumption cross-sectionally is blood alcohol concentration, which can also be used to judge tolerance to alcohol. For example, an individual with a concentration of 150 mg of ethanol per deciliter (dL) of blood who does not show signs of intoxication can be presumed to have acquired at least some degree of tolerance to alcohol.

"The essential feature of cannabis withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after the cessation of regular cannabis use. Regular users become tolerant to many acute cannabis effects, and cessation of regular use can lead to a cannabis withdrawal syndrome. Common cannabis withdrawal symptoms include irritability, depressed mood, anxiety, restlessness, sleep difficulty, and decreased appetite or weight loss. Cannabis withdrawal can cause significant distress, leading to continued use to relieve the symptoms, difficulty in quitting, and relapse. Unlike withdrawal from other substances (i.e., opioids, alcohol, sedatives), behavioral and emotional symptoms (e.g., nervousness, irritability, sleep difficulty) are often more common than physical symptoms (e.g., shakiness, sweating).",DSM-book_3255,Diagnostic Features,Anxiety,DSM-book,reference,803

Discerning whether symptoms occurred before the intake of the drug is important in the differentiation of acute drug effects from a preexisting mental disorder.

"Stimulants are a type of psychoactive substance that increases activity in the brain and can temporarily elevate alertness, mood, and awareness. Stimulants covered in this chapter include amphetamine and prescription stimulants with similar effects (e.g., methylphenidate) and cocaine. Substance-related disorders involving certain other substances with stimulant properties are classified in other sections of this chapter. These include caffeine (in caffeine-related disorders), nicotine (in tobacco-related disorders), and MDMA (3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine; in other hallucinogen-related disorders), which has both stimulant and hallucinogenic effects. Given that the effects of amphetamine-type substances are similar to those of cocaine, amphetamine-related disorders and cocaine-related disorders are grouped under the single rubric “stimulant-related disorders.” Amphetamine-type substances (and other or unspecified stimulants) and cocaine have different ICD-10-CM codes (e.g., F15.10",DSM-book_3518,Diagnostic Features,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,865

"Gambling involves risking something of value in the hopes of obtaining something of greater value. In many cultures, individuals gamble on games and events, and most do so without experiencing problems. However, some individuals develop substantial impairment related to their gambling behaviors. The essential feature of gambling disorder is persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behavior that disrupts personal, family, and/or vocational pursuits (Criterion A). Gambling disorder is defined as a cluster of four or more of the symptoms listed in Criterion A occurring at any time in the same 12-month period. A pattern of “chasing one’s losses” may develop, with an urgent need to continue gambling (often with placing larger bets or taking greater risks) to undo a loss or series of losses. The individual may abandon a gambling strategy and try to win back losses all at once.

Individuals may lie to family members, therapists, or others to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling; these instances of deceit may also include, but are not limited to, covering up illegal behaviors such as forgery, fraud, theft, or embezzlement to obtain money with which to gamble (Criterion A7). Individuals may also engage in “bailout” behavior, turning to family or others for help with a desperate financial situation that was caused by gambling (Criterion A9). In some cases, symptoms meeting diagnostic criteria for gambling disorder may occur as a direct physiological consequence of taking dopaminergic medications, such as those used to treat Parkinson’s disease. When such symptoms are induced by a medication, these cases would be diagnosed as gambling disorder.",DSM-book_3665,Diagnostic Features,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,898

National data from the United States and Canada show that most individuals who develop a gambling disorder evidence a pattern of gambling that gradually increases in both frequency and amount of wagering. Certainly, milder forms can develop into more severe cases. Most individuals with gambling disorder report that one or two types of gambling are most problematic for them, although some individuals participate in many forms of gambling.

Similarly, amounts of money spent wagering are not in themselves indicative of gambling disorder. Some individuals can wager thousands of dollars per month and not have a problem with gambling, while others may wager much smaller amounts but experience substantial gambling-related difficulties. Gambling patterns may be regular or episodic, and gambling disorder can be persistent or in remission.

U.S.-born individuals have higher rates of gambling problems than first-generation immigrants to the United States. Endorsement of specific disorder criteria may vary across ethnoracial groups.

"The essential feature of delirium is an acute impairment of consciousness characterized by a disturbance in attention accompanied by reduced awareness of the environment, both core features of normal consciousness. Because these deficits reflect an altered state of consciousness affecting many higher cerebral cortical functions of the cerebral cortex, they are accompanied by a change from baseline in other cognitive functions that cannot be better explained by a preexisting or evolving neurocognitive disorder (NCD). The disturbance in attention (Criterion A) is manifested by reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention. Questions must be repeated because the individual’s attention wanders, or the individual may perseverate with an answer to a previous question rather than appropriately shift attention.

Normal attention/arousal, delirium, and coma lie on a continuum. Coma is defined as a state of unconsciousness with an absence of cognition or sleep-wake cycle, along with the lack of any meaningful response to verbal or physical stimuli.

Those individuals who show only minimal responses to verbal or physical stimulation are incapable of engaging with attempts at standardized testing or even interview. This inability to engage should be classified as a disorder of arousal such as coma or stupor, and not as delirium.

"Major and mild NCDs exist on a spectrum of cognitive and functional impairment. Major NCD roughly corresponds to the condition labeled in ICD-10 and ICD-11 (as well as in DSM-IV) as dementia . The core feature of NCDs is acquired cognitive decline in one or more cognitive domains (Criterion A) based on both 1) a concern about cognition on the part of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician, and 2) performance on an objective assessment that falls below the expected level or that has been observed to decline over time. Both a concern and objective evidence are required because they are complementary. When there is an exclusive focus on objective testing, a disorder may go undiagnosed in high-functioning individuals whose currently “normal” performance actually represents a substantial decline in abilities, or an illness may be incorrectly diagnosed in individuals whose currently “low” performance does not represent a change from their own baseline or is a result of",DSM-book_3758,Diagnostic Features,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,922

Alternatively, excessive focus on subjective symptoms may fail to diagnose illness in individuals with poor insight, or whose informants deny or fail to notice their symptoms, or it may be overly sensitive in the so-called worried well. A cognitive concern differs from a complaint in that it may or may not be voiced spontaneously. Rather, it may need to be elicited by careful questioning about specific symptoms that commonly occur in individuals with cognitive deficits (see Table 1 in the introduction to this chapter). For example, memory concerns include difficulty remembering a short grocery list or keeping track of the plot of a television program; executive concerns include difficulty resuming a task when interrupted, organizing tax records, or planning a holiday meal.

At the major NCD level, such tasks may only be completed with assistance or may be abandoned altogether. At the mild NCD level, individuals and their families may not notice such symptoms or may view them as normal, particularly in the elderly; thus, careful history taking is of paramount importance. The difficulties must represent changes rather than lifelong patterns: the individual or informant may clarify this issue, or the clinician can infer change from prior experience with the individual or from occupational or other clues. It is also critical to determine that the difficulties are related to cognitive loss rather than to motor or sensory limitations.

For major NCD, performance is typically 2 or more standard deviations below appropriate norms (3rd percentile or below). For mild NCD, performance typically lies in the 1–2 standard deviation range (between the 3rd and 16th percentiles).

Norms are more challenging to interpret in individuals with very high or very low levels of education and in individuals being tested outside their own language or cultural background. Criterion B relates to the individual’s level of independence in everyday functioning.

Others may fluctuate over time (although if this occurs, the possibility of delirium superimposed on NCD should be considered). NCDs due to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease or frontotemporal degeneration typically are marked by insidious onset and gradual progression, and the pattern of onset of cognitive deficits and associated features helps to distinguish among them.

More data are available on the prevalence of inhalant use. Such exposure has been linked to both major and mild NCD of varied duration in both higher- and lower-income populations.

Acquisition of HIV infection typically occurs in adults in high-income countries, via high- risk behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex; injection substance use) beginning in late adolescence and peaking during young and middle adulthood, with a significant contribution persisting into older age. In lower-income regions, where HIV testing and antiretroviral treatments for pregnant women are not readily available, perinatal transmission is common. The NCD in such infants and children may manifest primarily as neurodevelopmental delay. As individuals treated for HIV survive into older age, additive and interactive neurocognitive effects of HIV and aging, including other NCDs (e.g., due to Alzheimer’s disease, due to Parkinson’s disease), are possible.",DSM-book_3935,Development And Course,Therapy Process,DSM-book,reference,963

HIV infection itself has been shown to increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. Because more severe immunodeficiency can result in opportunistic infections of the brain (e.g., toxoplasmosis; cryptococcosis) and neoplasia (e.g., CNS lymphoma), sudden 721 onset of an NCD or sudden worsening of an NCD demands active investigation of non-HIV etiologies.

Their combative and suspicious nature may elicit a hostile response in others, which then serves to confirm their original expectations. Because individuals with paranoid personality disorder lack trust in others, they need to have a high degree of control over those around them.

"The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. This pattern has also been referred to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or dyssocial personality disorder. Because deceit and manipulation are central features of antisocial personality disorder, it may be especially helpful to integrate information acquired from systematic clinical assessment with information collected from collateral sources. 749 For this diagnosis to be given, the individual must be at least age 18 years (Criterion B) and must have had evidence of conduct disorder with onset before age 15 years (Criterion C). Conduct disorder involves a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated.

They may repeatedly perform acts that are grounds for arrest (whether they are arrested or not), such as destroying property, harassing others, stealing, or pursuing illegal occupations. Persons with this disorder disregard the wishes, rights, or feelings of others.

Additionally, studies have shown that avoidant personality disorder frequently occurs in the absence of social anxiety disorder, and some separate risk factors have been identified, providing support for retaining two separate diagnostic categories.

In this chapter, the order of presentation of the listed paraphilic disorders generally corresponds to common classification schemes for these conditions. The first group of disorders is based on anomalous activity preferences. These disorders are subdivided into courtship disorders, which resemble distorted components of human courtship behavior (voyeuristic disorder, exhibitionistic disorder, and frotteuristic disorder), and algolagnic disorders, which involve pain and suffering (sexual masochism disorder and sexual sadism disorder).

The term paraphilia denotes any intense and persistent sexual interest other than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically normal, physically mature, consenting human partners. In some circumstances, the criteria “intense and persistent” may be difficult to apply, such as in the assessment of persons who are very old or medically ill and who may not have “intense” sexual interests of any kind. In such circumstances, the term paraphilia may be defined as any sexual interest greater than or equal to nonparaphilic sexual interests.

A paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a paraphilic disorder, and a paraphilia by itself does not necessarily justify or require clinical intervention. In the diagnostic criteria set for each of the listed paraphilic disorders, Criterion A specifies the qualitative nature of the paraphilia (e.g., an erotic focus on children or on exposing the genitals to strangers), and Criterion B specifies the negative consequences of the paraphilia (i.e., distress, impairment, or harm to others).

If an individual’s paraphilic interests or behaviors meet Criterion A but not Criterion B for a particular paraphilia—a circumstance that might arise when a benign paraphilia is discovered during the clinical investigation of some other condition—then the individual may be said to have that paraphilia but not a paraphilic disorder. It is not rare for an individual to manifest two or more paraphilias. In some cases, the paraphilic foci are closely related and the connection between the paraphilias is intuitively comprehensible (e.g., foot fetishism and shoe fetishism).

In severe cases, it may be associated with medical complications (e.g., ulcers in cheeks and tongue; loss of teeth; macroglossia; difficulty in walking, swallowing, or breathing; muffled speech; weight loss; depression; suicidal ideation). In older individuals there is a greater 816 likelihood that tardive dyskinesia may become more severe or more generalized with continued antipsychotic medication use.

"It is imperative to distinguish medication-induced parkinsonism from tardive dyskinesia because the treatments commonly used to manage medication-induced parkinsonism (i.e., anticholinergic medications) may worsen the abnormal motor movements associated with tardive dyskinesia. Moreover, treatments used to manage tardive dyskinesia (i.e., VMAT2 inhibitors) may worsen the symptoms of medication-induced parkinsonism. Dyskinesia that emerges during withdrawal from an antipsychotic medication or other dopamine receptor blocking agent may remit with continued withdrawal from the medication. If the dyskinesia persists for at least 4 weeks, a diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia may be warranted. Tardive dyskinesia must be distinguished from other causes of orofacial and body dyskinesia.",DSM-book_4446,Differential Diagnosis,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,1079

Factors that may be helpful in making the distinction are evidence that the symptoms preceded the exposure to the antipsychotic medication or other dopamine receptor blocking agent or that other focal neurological signs are present. It should be noted that other movement disorders may coexist with tardive dyskinesia. Because spontaneous dyskinesia can occur in more than 5% of individuals and is also more common in elderly persons, it may be difficult to prove that antipsychotic medications produced tardive dyskinesia in a given individual.

Tardive dyskinesia, on the other hand, generally develops after more prolonged exposure to antipsychotic medication (months to years) and can appear after the withdrawal of antipsychotic medication; the minimum exposure history required for the diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia is antipsychotic medication use for at least 3 months (or 1 month in middle-age and elderly individuals).",DSM-book_4448,Differential Diagnosis,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,1080

The tremor is a regular, rhythmic oscillation of the limbs (most commonly hands and fingers), head, mouth, or tongue, most commonly with a frequency of between 8 and 12 cycles per second. It is most easily observed when the affected body part is held in a sustained posture (e.g., hands outstretched, mouth held open).

When an individual describes a tremor that is consistent with postural tremor but the clinician does not directly observe the tremor, it may be helpful to try to re-create the situation in which the tremor occurred (e.g., drinking from a cup and saucer). Most available information concerns lithium-induced tremor. Lithium tremor is a common, usually benign, and well-tolerated side effect of therapeutic doses. However, it may cause social embarrassment, occupational difficulties, and noncompliance in some individuals. As serum lithium levels approach toxic levels, the tremor may become coarser and be accompanied by muscle twitching, fasciculations, or ataxia. Nontoxic lithium tremor may improve spontaneously over time.

"Discontinuation symptoms may occur following treatment with all types of antidepressants. The incidence of this syndrome depends on the dosage and half-life of the medication being taken, as well as the rate at which the medication is tapered. Short half-life medications that are abruptly discontinued (or when the dose is significantly reduced) rather than tapered gradually may pose the greatest risk. The short-acting antidepressants paroxetine and venlafaxine are the agents most commonly associated with discontinuation symptoms. Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome may occur in the context of intermittent non-adherence to treatment and therefore may be irregularly present in some individuals who have not actually stopped taking the medication.

Also, when a stimulant is used to augment an antidepressant, abrupt cessation may result in stimulant withdrawal symptoms (see “Stimulant Withdrawal” in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders”) rather than the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome described here. The prevalence of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is unknown but is thought to vary according to any of the following factors: the dosage before discontinuation, the half-life (i.e., occurring more commonly with short half-life medications) and receptor-binding affinity of the medication (e.g., more likely to occur with serotonin reuptake inhibitors),",DSM-book_4458,T43.205S Sequelae,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,1082

Limitations of a categorical approach to diagnosis include the failure to find zones of rarity between diagnoses (i.e., delineation of mental disorders from one another by natural boundaries), need for intermediate categories like schizoaffective disorder, high rates of comorbidity, need for frequent use of other or unspecified diagnoses, relative lack of utility in furthering identification of unique antecedent validators for most mental disorders, and lack of treatment specificity for the various diagnostic categories. From both clinical and research perspectives, there is a need for a more dimensional approach that can be combined with DSM’s set of categorical diagnoses to better capture the heterogeneity in the presentation of various mental and substance use disorders.

It is expected that as the understanding of basic disease mechanisms for mental and substance use disorders based on pathophysiology, neurocircuitry, and gene-environment interactions increases, more objective measures of psychopathology will be incorporated into the diagnostic criteria sets to enhance their accuracy.

A similar review of various mental systems (or domains), which is the goal of the cross-cutting symptom measures, can aid in a more comprehensive mental status assessment of individuals at the initial evaluation.

Thus, use of these measures can form key aspects of measurement-based care, the process by which standardized assessment tools are 842 administered and results used to track individuals’ progress over time to guide a more precise plan of care. Use of these measures ultimately aims to inform measurement-based care by identifying areas of emerging symptoms and concerns as well as supporting ongoing symptom monitoring, treatment adjustment, and outcomes critical to the provision of quality care for individuals with mental and substance use disorders. As a result, these cross-cutting symptom measures have been identified as important components of psychiatric diagnostic assessment in clinical practice guidelines.

Some of the assessments are self- rated, while others are rated by the clinician based on observation of the individual. As with the cross-cutting symptom measures, these measures can be administered both at initial interview and over time to track the severity of the individual’s disorder and response to treatment. These assessments help operationalize symptom frequency, intensity, or duration; overall symptom severity; or symptom type (e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance) for many, though not all, DSM-5 diagnoses (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, psychotic disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and social (pragmatic)",DSM-book_4536,A Growing Body  Of Scientific Evidence Favors Dimensional Concepts In The Diagnosis Of,Anxiety,DSM-book,reference,1109

This version of the scale is self-administered and was developed for individuals with any medical condition, not just mental disorders.

Individuals with mental disorders are more likely to have severe impairment in functioning (i.e., communicating or understanding; getting along with others; carrying out daily activities at work, home, or school; participating in social activities) compared to individuals with chronic medical conditions.

"The DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure is a self- or informant-rated measure that assesses domains that are important across psychiatric diagnoses. It is intended to help clinicians identify additional areas of inquiry that may have significant impact on the individual’s treatment and prognosis. In addition, the measure may be used to track changes in the individual’s symptom presentation over time. The adult version of the measure consists of 23 questions that assess 13 psychiatric domains, including depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use ( Table 1 ). Each domain consists of one to three questions. Each item inquires about how much (or how often) the individual has been bothered by the specific symptom during the past 2 weeks.

"The adult self-administered version of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) is a 36-item measure that assesses disability in adults age 18 years and older. It has been validated across numerous cultures worldwide and demonstrated sensitivity to change. It assesses disability across six domains, including understanding and communicating, getting around, self-care, getting along with people, life activities (i.e., household, work, and/or school activities), and participation in society. If the adult individual is of impaired capacity and unable to complete the form (e.g., a patient with major neurocognitive disorder), a knowledgeable informant may complete the proxy-administered version of the measure, which is available at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5 .

"There are two basic options for computing the summary scores for the WHODAS 2.0 36-item full version. Simple: The scores assigned to each of the items—“none” (1), “mild” (2), “moderate” (3), “severe” (4), and “extreme” (5)—are summed for a maximum total raw score of 180. This method is referred to as simple scoring because the scores from each of the items are simply added up without recoding or collapsing of response categories; thus, there is no weighting of individual items. This approach is practical to use as a hand-scoring approach, and may be the method of choice in busy clinical settings or in paper-and-pencil interview situations. As a result, the simple sum of the scores of the items across all domains constitutes a statistic that is sufficient to describe the degree of functional limitations. Complex: The more complex method of scoring is called “item-response-theory” (IRT)– based scoring. It takes into account multiple levels of difficulty for each WHODAS 2.0 item.

The computer program is available from the WHO Web site. The scoring has three steps: Step 1—Summing of recoded item scores within each domain (i.e., for each item, the response options 1–5 are converted to a rate of 0–4, leading to a total raw score of 144). Step 2—Summing of all six domain scores. Step 3—Converting the summary score into a metric ranging from 0 to 100 (where 0 = no disability; 100 = full disability).

Based on findings from the DSM-5 Field Trials in adult patient samples across six sites in the United States and one in Canada, DSM-5-TR recommends calculation and use of average scores for each domain and for general disability. The average scores are comparable to the WHODAS 5-point scale, which allows the clinician to think of the individual’s disability in terms of none (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or extreme (5).

The average general disability score is calculated by dividing the raw overall score by number of items in the measure (i.e., 36).

The construct of race is important for psychiatry because it can lead to racial ideologies, racism, discrimination, and social oppression and exclusion, which have strong negative effects on mental health.

"The term cultural concepts of distress refers to ways that individuals experience, understand, and communicate suffering, behavioral problems, or troubling thoughts and emotions. Three main types of cultural concepts of distress may be distinguished. Cultural idioms of distress are ways of expressing distress that may not involve specific symptoms or syndromes, but that provide collective, shared ways of experiencing and talking about personal or social concerns. For example, everyday talk about “nerves” or “depression” may refer to widely varying forms of suffering without mapping onto a discrete set of symptoms, syndrome, or disorder. Cultural explanations or perceived causes are labels, attributions, or features of an explanatory model that indicate culturally recognized meaning or etiology for symptoms, illness, or distress. Cultural syndromes are clusters of symptoms and attributions that tend to co-occur among individuals in specific cultural groups, communities, or contexts and",DSM-book_4627,Relevance For Diagnostic Assessment,Depression,DSM-book,reference,1135
"that tend to co-occur among individuals in specific cultural groups, communities, or contexts and that are recognized locally as coherent patterns of experience. These three cultural concepts of distress—cultural idioms of distress, cultural explanations, and cultural syndromes—are more relevant to clinical practice than the older formulation culture-bound syndrome . Specifically, the term culture-bound syndrome ignores the fact that clinically important cultural differences often involve explanations or experience of distress rather than culturally distinctive configurations of symptoms. Furthermore, the term culture bound overemphasizes the extent to which cultural concepts of distress are characterized by highly idiosyncratic experiences that are restricted to specific geographic regions. The current formulation acknowledges that all forms of distress are locally shaped, including the DSM disorders. From this perspective, many DSM diagnoses can be understood as operationalized",DSM-book_4628,Relevance For Diagnostic Assessment,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,1135
"the DSM disorders. From this perspective, many DSM diagnoses can be understood as operationalized prototypes that started out as cultural syndromes and became widely accepted as a result of their clinical and research utility. Across groups there remain culturally patterned differences in symptoms, ways of talking about distress, and locally perceived causes, which in turn are associated with coping strategies and patterns of help seeking. Cultural concepts of distress arise from local “folk” or professional diagnostic systems for mental and emotional distress, and they may also reflect the influence of 872 biomedical concepts. Cultural concepts of distress have four key features in relation to the DSM-5 nosology: There is seldom a one-to-one correspondence of any cultural concept of distress with a DSM diagnostic entity; the correspondence is more likely to be one-to-many in either direction. Symptoms or behaviors that might be sorted by DSM-5 into several disorders may be included",DSM-book_4629,Relevance For Diagnostic Assessment,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,1135
"Symptoms or behaviors that might be sorted by DSM-5 into several disorders may be included in a single cultural concept of distress, and diverse presentations that might be classified by DSM-5 as variants of a single disorder may be sorted into several distinct concepts by an indigenous diagnostic system.

In common usage, the same cultural term frequently denotes more than one type of cultural concept of distress. A familiar example may be the concept of “depression,” which may be used to describe a syndrome (e.g., major depressive disorder), an idiom of distress (e.g., as in the common expression “I feel depressed”), or an explanation or perceived cause (e.g., “the baby was born with emotional problems because his mother suffered from depression during her pregnancy”). Like culture and DSM itself, cultural concepts of distress may change over time in response to both local and global influences.

To avoid misdiagnosis: Cultural variation in symptoms and in explanatory models associated with these cultural concepts of distress may lead clinicians to misjudge the severity of a problem or assign the wrong diagnosis (e.g., socially warranted suspicion may be misunderstood as paranoia; unfamiliar symptom presentations may be misdiagnosed as psychosis). To obtain useful clinical information: Cultural variations in symptoms and attributions may be associated with particular features of risk, resilience, and outcome.

To improve clinical rapport and engagement: “Speaking the language of the patient,” both linguistically and in terms of his or her dominant cultural concepts of distress and metaphors, can result in greater communication and satisfaction, facilitate treatment negotiation, and lead to higher retention and adherence. To improve therapeutic efficacy: Culture influences the psychological mechanisms of a disorder, which need to be understood and addressed to improve clinical efficacy. For example, culturally specific catastrophic cognitions can contribute to symptom escalation into panic attacks.

To clarify cultural epidemiology: Cultural concepts of distress are not endorsed uniformly by everyone in a given cultural context. Distinguishing cultural idioms of distress, cultural explanations, and cultural syndromes provides an approach for studying the distribution of cultural features of illness across settings and regions, and over time. It also suggests questions about cultural determinants of risk, course, and outcome in clinical and community settings to enhance the evidence base of cultural research.

In addition to the CFI and its informant and supplementary modules, DSM-5-TR contains the following information and tools that may be useful when integrating cultural information in clinical practice: Data in updated DSM-5-TR text for specific disorders: The text includes information on cultural variations in symptom expression; attributions for disorder causes or precipitants; factors associated with differential prevalence across demographic groups; cultural norms that may affect the threshold for pathology and the perceived severity of the condition; risk for misdiagnosis when evaluating",DSM-book_4636,Relevance For Diagnostic Assessment,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,1137

It is important to emphasize that there is no one-to-one correspondence at the categorical level between DSM disorders and cultural concepts of distress. Differential diagnosis for individuals must therefore incorporate information on cultural variation with information elicited by the CFI. Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention: Some of the clinical concerns identified by the CFI may correspond to one of the conditions or problems listed in the Section II chapter “Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention” (e.g., acculturation problems, parent-child relational problems, religious or spiritual problems), along with the associated ICD-10-CM code.",DSM-book_4637,Relevance For Diagnostic Assessment,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,1137

The principles illustrated with these examples can be applied to the myriad other cultural concepts of distress found in specific cultural contexts.

A personality trait is a tendency to feel, perceive, behave, and think in relatively consistent ways across time and across situations in which the trait may manifest. For example, individuals with a high level of the personality trait of anxiousness would tend to feel anxious readily, including in circumstances in which most people would be calm and relaxed. Individuals high in trait anxiousness also would perceive situations to be anxiety-provoking more frequently than would individuals with lower levels of this trait, and those high in the trait would tend to behave so as to avoid situations that they think would make them anxious. They would thereby tend to think about the world as more anxiety provoking than other people.

All individuals can be located on the spectrum of trait dimensions; that is, personality traits apply to everyone in different degrees rather than being present versus absent. Moreover, personality traits, including those identified specifically in the Section III model, exist on a spectrum with two opposing poles. For example, the opposite of the trait of callousness is the tendency to be empathic and kind-hearted, even in circumstances in which most persons would not feel that way.

Personality trait domains comprise a spectrum of more specific personality facets that tend to occur together. For example, withdrawal and anhedonia are specific trait facets in the trait domain of Detachment.

Table 3 provides definitions of all personality domains and facets. These five broad domains are maladaptive variants of the five domains of the extensively validated and replicated personality model known as the “Big Five,” or Five Factor Model of personality (FFM), and are also similar to the domains of the Personality Psychopathology Five (PSY-5).

Nevertheless, it is important to recognize, for example, that even people who are impulsive are not acting impulsively all of the time.

Rather than focusing attention on the identification of one and only one optimal diagnostic label, clinical application of the Section III personality trait model involves reviewing all five broad personality domains portrayed in Table 3 . The clinical approach to personality is similar to the well-known review of systems in clinical medicine. For example, an individual’s presenting complaint may focus on a specific neurological symptom, yet during an initial evaluation clinicians still systematically review functioning in all relevant systems (e.g., cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal), lest an important area of diminished functioning and corresponding opportunity for effective intervention be missed.

However, schizotypal personality disorder is a relatively stable trait disorder not meeting the state-dependent aspects (Criterion C) of attenuated psychosis syndrome. In addition, a broader array of symptoms is required for the diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder.

If these reality distortions occur only during 907 the course of another mental disorder, an additional diagnosis of attenuated psychosis syndrome would not be made.

Generally, overdoses with legal or illegal substances are considered nonviolent in method, whereas jumping, gunshot wounds, and other methods are considered violent. Another dimension for classification is medical consequences of the behavior, with high-lethality attempts being defined as those requiring medical hospitalization beyond a visit to an emergency 921 department. An additional dimension considered includes the degree of planning versus impulsiveness of the attempt, a characteristic that might have consequences for the medical outcome of a suicide attempt.

The behavior might or might not lead to injury or serious medical consequences. Several factors can influence the medical consequences of the suicide attempt, including poor planning, lack of knowledge about the lethality of the method chosen, low intentionality or ambivalence, or chance intervention by others after the behavior has been initiated. These should not be considered in assigning the diagnosis. Determining the degree of intent can be challenging. Individuals might not acknowledge intent, especially in situations where doing so could result in hospitalization or cause distress to loved ones. Markers of risk include degree of planning, including selection of a time and place to minimize rescue or interruption; the individual’s mental state at the time of the behavior, with acute agitation being",DSM-book_4859,Diagnostic Features,Diagnosis,DSM-book,reference,1190

Conversely, features such as talking to others about future events or preparedness to sign a contract for safety are less reliable indicators. In order for the criteria to be met, the individual must have made at least one suicide attempt.

If the individual is dissuaded by another or changes his or her mind before initiating the behavior, the diagnosis should not be made. The acts qualifying for a diagnosis of suicidal behavior disorder should not have been initiated exclusively during a state of delirium or confusion. If the individual deliberately became intoxicated before initiating the suicidal behavior in order to reduce anticipatory anxiety and to minimize interference with the intended behavior, the diagnosis can still be made.

These patterns vary over time, by migrant or ethnic group, and by service setting. Culturally mediated social stressors and predicaments such as family breakdowns, perceived loss of dignity or interpersonal status, conflicting intergenerational roles and expectations due to differential acculturation, changing levels of sociocultural integration, stigma and self-stigma about suicide, and systemic discrimination and structural inequity (institutionalized socioeconomic bias and oppression) may contribute to the risk of suicidal behavior disorder.

Men generally use more lethal methods such as gunshots and hanging, whereas less lethal means such as self-poisoning are more common in women. The frequency of suicidal behaviors is higher in women (i.e., the average number of suicide attempts for a woman is generally higher than the average number for a man), but this could be explained by the more frequent use of less lethal methods among women.
